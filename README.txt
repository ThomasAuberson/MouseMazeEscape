ABOUT: Mouse Maze Escape
You are a MOUSE!
You are in a MAZE!!
You must ESCAPE!!!

----------------------

HOW TO RUN:
1. You will need to install the latest version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
   This can be found on the Oracle website.

2. No installation is necessary. Simply run the JAR file FlashCardz.jar

----------------------

HOW TO PLAY:
* You must reach the end of each maze (represented by a RED tile) before the time
  runs out to progress to next level. Failure to do so will result in losing a life.
* The mazes get bigger (and ergo harder) with each level. Note the time limit also 
  increases (by 5s per level).
* Use the arrow keys UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT to maneuvre through the maze.
* Use SPACE to jump over walls! This ability uses cheese points which are earned 
  automatically as your score increases.
